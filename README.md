In advertisment : Our data is about 




A Kenyan entrepreneur has created an online cryptography course and would want to advertise it on her blog. She currently targets audiences originating from various countries. In the past, she ran ads to advertise a related course on the same blog and collected data in the process.






We will be tasked to create a supervised learning model to help identify which individuals are most likely to click on the ads in the blog. 




**PART 2**





In Ecommerce: Our data is about 

Kira Plastinina a Russian brand that is sold through a defunct chain of retail stores in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus, China, Philippines, and Armenia. The brand’s Sales and Marketing team would like to understand their customer’s behavior from data that they have collected over the past year. More specifically, they would like to learn the characteristics of customer groups.





We are going to perform clustering stating insights drawn from your analysis and visualizations.
Upon implementation, provide comparisons between the approaches learned this week i.e. K-Means clustering vs Hierarchical clustering highlighting the strengths and limitations of each approach in the context of your analysis.
